Nathan's photonic in-memory computing paper in collaboration with the [Pernice group](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.PI/Pernice/) at the University of Muenster, the [Bhaskaran group](https://nanoeng.materials.ox.ac.uk/) at Oxford, the [Kippenberg group](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/k-lab/) at EPFL, and [Abu Sebastian](http://researcher.ibm.com/person/zurich-ASE) at IBM Zurich has been accepted for publication in ***Nature***! Look out for more details in the near future, but for now you can check out the arXiv'd manuscript [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00281).
