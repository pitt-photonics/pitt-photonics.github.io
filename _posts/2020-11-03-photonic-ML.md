Nathan's photonic in-memory computing paper in collaboration with the Pernice group at the University of Muenster, the Bhaskaran group at Oxford, the Kippenberg group at EPFL, and Abu Sebastian's group at IBM Zurich has been accepted for publication in ***Nature***! Look out for more details in the near future, but for now you can check out the arXiv'd manuscript [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00281).
