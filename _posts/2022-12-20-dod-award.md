We are excited to announce the start of a collaborative DoD project with [Accipiter Systems](https://www.accipitersystems.com/) entitled, "High Throughput Photonic Processor for AI/ML programs." Processing information in the photonic analog domain can enable high computational throughput through multi-dimensional parallelization in space, time, and frequency. In this two-year project, we will work with Accipiter to develop a modular photonic computing prototype which can handle high resolution, high framerate video processing in real time. Watch this space for more details in the future!
