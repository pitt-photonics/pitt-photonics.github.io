Our collaborative proposal entitled, "A Hybrid Co-processing Unit (HCU) using Phase-change Photonics in CMOS for Large-scale and Ultra-fast Machine Learning Acceleration" has been funded by NSF! Our lab will be collaborating with lead PI Sajjad Moazeni (UW) and co-PIs Mo Li (UW) and Lei Jiang (IU) to develop hybrid electronic-photonic processors to accelerate machine learning tasks. We are excited to start working on this high impact technology ASAP!
