We are excited to report the award of another collaborative NSF grant entitled, "Fast and efficient phase-change photonics using low-dimensional materials." We will be working with our good friend Prof. Carlos Rios (UMD) who is leading this project and is a pioneer in [optical phase-change materials](https://blog.umd.edu/rios/). Our groups will be working together to develop electrically programmable phase-change photonic memory using 2D heterostructures to achieve faster and more efficient integrated control.
