Our photonic in-memory computing paper in collaboration with the [Pernice group](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.PI/Pernice/) at the University of Muenster, the [Bhaskaran group](https://nanoeng.materials.ox.ac.uk/) at Oxford, the [Kippenberg group](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/k-lab/) at EPFL, and [Abu Sebastian](http://researcher.ibm.com/person/zurich-ASE) at IBM Zurich has been published in [***Nature***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03070-1)! This work represents a major step forward in optical computing and is the first demonstration of combining both in-memory computing and computational multiplexing on an integrated photonic chip.
