Group member Nicholas Nobile's article entitled "Time-Resolved Temperature Mapping Leveraging the Strong Thermo-Optic Effect in Phase-Change Materials" is published in [ACS Photonics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.3c00620)! This work demonstrates a method to experimentally validate dynamic thermal simulations of electrically-switched GST pixels. Congratulations, Nic!
