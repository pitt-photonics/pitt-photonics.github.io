We are happy to announce **five** new papers which have been published by YPL and our collaborators within the last few months. Here is a brief description of each:

* ***Optica:*** ["Monadic Pavlovian associative learning in a backpropagation-free photonic network."](https://doi.org/10.1364/OPTICA.455864) Phase-change photonic memory is used to associate two optical pulses and is applied to image recognition (distinguishing between cat and dog faces). This work lead by James and Zengguang was inspired by Pavlov's dog experiments.

* ***IEEE JSTQE:*** ["Coherent photonic crossbar arrays for large-scale matrix-matrix multiplication."](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2022.3171167) We propose combining a time-multiplexed, homodyne approach with photonic crossbar arrays to achieve large-scale matrix multiplication. This decouples analog-to-digital conversion speeds from the modulation of optical signals, leading to much greater energy savings per MAC than other approaches.

* ***Nanophotonics:*** ["Photonic (computational) memories: tunable nanophotonics for data storage and computing."](https://doi.org/10.1515/nanoph-2022-0089) A comprehensive review article on memory technologies for photonic computing.

* ***Advanced Science:*** ["Electronically reconfigurable photonic switches incorporating phase change plasmonics."](https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202200383) An improvement of our previous [mixed-mode memory work](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaw2687) which combines indirect thermal heating with a waveguide-integrated plasmonic memory cell to achieve best-in-class electrical PCM switching efficiency.

* ***Optics Express:*** ["Designing fast and efficient electrically-driven phase change photonics using foundry compatible waveguide-integrated microheaters."](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.446984) A collaborative paper with Feng Xiong's group modeling various electro-thermally switched phase-change memory when integrated on a photonic waveguide. Methods to improve the switching efficiency and speed of waveguide-integrated PIN microheaters is comprehensively studied.
