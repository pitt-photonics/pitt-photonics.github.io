The IBM [research blog](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/02/photonic-memory-devices/) and [Nature Electronics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-019-0226-1) covered Carlos Rios and Nathan's publication demonstrating in-memory computing on a photonics platform. Read about it [here](http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau5759).
