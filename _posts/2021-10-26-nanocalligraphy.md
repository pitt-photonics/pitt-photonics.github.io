Congratulations to Nikolaos Farmakidis from the Advanced Nanoscale Engineering group at Oxford for his new paper entitled, "[Exploiting rotational asymmetry for sub-50 nm mechanical nanocalligraphy](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41378-021-00300-y)." This novel approach to nanolithography enabled Nik and co-lead author Jacob Swett to create complex patterns at the nanoscale inspired by the artwork of calligraphy artist [Majid Alyousef](https://majidalyousef.com/).
