Our collaborative work entitled "High-speed multifunctional photonic memory on a foundry-processed photonic platform" is now published in [Optica](https://doi.org/10.1364/OPTICA.536866)! In this work, we demonstrate that both volatile fine-tuning and nonvolatile course-tuning of photonic devices can be achieved within a single device using a PN junction and low-loss phase-change materials. This can significantly improve the speed, efficiency, and endurance of phase-change photonic memory for data processing and other applications. Congratulations to lead author, Sadra, and our collaborators at Queen's University and University of Maryland, College Park!
