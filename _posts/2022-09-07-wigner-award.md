Our collaborative proposal entitled, "Waveguide-Integrated Graphene Nano-tweezERs (WIGNER) for rapid sorting and analysis of nanovesicles and viruses" has been funded by NSF! Our lab will be working with co-PI Sang-Hyun Oh (UMN), an expert in [trapping and sensing at the nanoscale](http://nanobio.umn.edu/Home.html), to develop a fully integrated optical platform for rapid sorting, trapping, and analysis of viruses and nanovesicles. We are also excited to be collaborating with Dr. Paul Duprex on this project. Dr. Duprex is the Director of Pitt's [Center for Vaccine Research](https://www.cvr.pitt.edu/) and will be providing our team with flourescently labeled virons for sorting and detection.
