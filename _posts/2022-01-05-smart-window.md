Our paper entitled, "[Reconfigurable Low-Emissivity Optical Coating Using Ultrathin Phase Change Materials](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsphotonics.1c01128)," has been published in ACS Photonics! Unlike most smart window technology which either transmits or blocks both visible and infrared light from the sun, we modulate our window's properties only in the infrared. This allows us to leave the window's visible transmission unchanged, creating a smart window which is energy efficient and asthetically pleasing. This work was a collaboration with the [Advanced Nanoscale Engineering](https://nanoeng.materials.ox.ac.uk/) group at the University of Oxford and [Bodle Technologies](https://www.bodletechnologies.com/).
