Nathan's second NSF proposal entitled, "High-endurance phase-change devices for electrically reconfigurable optical systems" was funded! Our lab will be working in collaboration with co-PI Feng Xiong at Pitt to investigate the mechanisms limiting the endurance and cyclability of electrically-controlled, phase-change photonic memory.
